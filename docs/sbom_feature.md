# Representing SBOM Dependencies as a Directory Tree or File Tree

## Why(Motivation) ??

An SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) provides detailed information about the components and dependencies of a software system. Often, this document contains numerous dependencies and sub-dependencies, making it time-consuming and tedious to manually navigate through them. For users primarily interested in visualizing these relationships, a directory or file tree structure—similar to the output of the tree command—offers a more intuitive and visual approach, allowing quick access to dependencies without the need to read through the entire document.
